# Log4J Exploit POC

This is an exploit to show the Log4Shell problem with Java.
Read more about the problem in this [article](https://snyk.io/blog/log4j-rce-log4shell-vulnerability-cve-2021-4428/)

The exploit is tested using Java __8u111__. JDK version greater than 6u211, 7u201, 8u191, and 11.0.1 do not seem to be affected 

## Howto

The compiled Evil.class is compiled with Java 8u111 and contains the command to open Calculator on MacOSX.
You can change this by editing Evil.java and recompile with `javac Evil.java`

- Serve Evil.class via http
```
cd <projectdir>/src/main/java
serve -port 8000
```

- Run Server.java

- Run main.java (with JDK 8u111)
